The objective of this repository is to provide explanatory material that helps in the design of questionnaires using Survey Solutions software.

Survey Solution (SuSo) is a free software developed by the World Bank with the objective of providing a technological platform for the conduct of wide-purpose surveys under CAPI, CATI or CAWI modalities.

Due to its convenience, this materials have been designed following a "learning by example" approach where real questionnaires situations are presented and a comprenhensive description of their implementation in SuSo is provided.

We chose the study examples based on the most asked questions registered in the user forum and in the frecuent questionnaires patterns that Survey Solution team made available in the public questionnaires section.
